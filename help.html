    <h3 id="b1">Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            Presenter Timer was developed as a tool to communicate the allocated time and current duration with a speaker/presenter on a stage. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Initially developed for private use by Cyber Illusions. On request by few in the event industry, this is now made available for anyone to use freely.
        </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3 id="b2">Typical Setup</h3>

        <p>
            The system is intended to use with "Extended Desktop" mode on a laptop.

                <h4>Menu</h4>

                <p>
                    Settings: Load and save timer settings and exit programme. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Timer display: Open the "Timer Display Window" in full screen or windowed mode. "Timer Display Window" can be closed only when timer is not running. 
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Timer Screen Preview</h4>

                <p>
                    Shows the content that will display on the main timer screen. The progress bar is only visible in the preview window.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Timer Controls</h4>

                <p>
                    "Start", "Pause" and "Stop" the timer. If the "Start" button is pressed after the timer has been "Stopped" the timer duration will be derived from the duration setup. Pressing "Stop" will bring up the "Message" immedietly. If "Stop" is pressed and the "Message" is empty, the display will show the current remaining time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The timer can be operated without "Timer Display Window" being launched. 
                </p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Duration Setup</h4>

                <p>
                   Set the duration of the timer by setting "Hours", "Minutes" and "Seconds". The maximum limit for each unit is 59.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Message Setup</h4>

                <p>
                   The "Message" will automatically be displayed with a red background at the end of the time duration. The "Message" can be displayed and hidden anytime by pressing the "Show" and "Hide" buttons. Leaving the "Message" blank will not display a message at the end of the timer duration.
                </p>
                <p>This is useful to send a message in middle of the presentation. The background will not turn red when sending a message while the timne is running.</p>

The winodow can be closed only when the timer is not running.
